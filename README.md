## What is this?

This project consists in a Compiler program written entirely in **Python** for the Compilers subject in my undergraduate degree. 

The compiler was made for a programming language called **Mars** that doesn't exist (yet). **Mars** is extremely simple and has just the limited functions that its grammar allows to do.

The compiler's name is an acronym for my name (**MAR**cos **VIN**Ã­cius) and it really means nothing beyond that. However, since this name remembers the [Looney Tunes' character "Marvin: The Martian"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Martian), the project name was quite inspired in this one.

## About Mars

As I said, Mars is a simple programming language and it counts with the following features:

- Allows the four base math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- One-line and multi-line comments
- It's not *case-sensitive*

## About the compiler

The compiler consists in 3 parts: 
- **[In Progress]** Lexical Analyser
- **[In Progress]** Syntax Analyser
- **[In Progress]** Semantic Analyser
