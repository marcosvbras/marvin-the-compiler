# Marvin Compiler

## What is this?

This project consists in a compiler for a programming language called **Marvin** that doesn't exist (yet). Marvin is extremely simple and has limited functions that its grammar allows.
The language's name is an acronym for my name (**MAR**cos **VIN**Ã­cius) and it really means nothing beyond that. However, since this name remembers Looney Tunes' character [Marvin, The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Martian), the logo was quite inspired in this one.
